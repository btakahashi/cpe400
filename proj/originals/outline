Learning channel access pattern in a multi-channel network
a: Learning algorithm design
b: Simulation/experiment design
c: results

Pick "fastest" channel with lowest cost

single 4-channel hub
	channels w/ different speeds

Start w/ 4 or less devices - initial testing

MAX 8 devices attempting to connect simultaneously or at different times

Steps:
generate values for access patterns
	Access Patterns
	-Speed available on channel
	-Avg amount of "traffic"
		-Traffic
		--Amount of users in channel
		--Expandable to: throughput of users and time spent in channel
	-Time of day
	
create "smart" algorithm to decide channel based on access patterns
	Weight calculations
	-Table based on ToD
	-initial weights
		-high for Speed
		-low for traffic
	Recheck on timer

Maybe: Carrier sense multiple acces w/ collision avoidance
